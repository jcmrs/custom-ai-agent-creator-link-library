# Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Methodologies for Collaboration and Iteration

This document distills SRE collaboration patterns and systematic error management practices tailored for the multi-agent AI creation environment.

Key principles include:
- Cross-disciplinary collaboration among domain experts
- Clear role boundaries balanced with shared ownership
- Explicit error taxonomies with pass/fail quality gating
- Rapid iterative cycles supported by checkpoint validation
- Root cause analysis integrated into continuous improvement
- Transparent artifact and context persistence for auditability

Applying these principles strengthens system resilience and fosters disciplined agent development.
