# Structured Workflow Steps for Custom AI Agent Creation

The workflow operationalizes domain-expert collaboration aligned with CLAUDE CODE agent development phases:

1. Project Discovery  
2. Environment and Framework Setup  
3. Baseline Agent Definition  
4. Enhanced Agent Methodology  
5. Resource Aggregation  
6. Agent Specification and Output  
7. Continuous Feedback and Iteration  

Each step assigns domain lead responsibilities and includes synchronous and asynchronous checkpoints to maximize alignment and iterative refinement.

Refer to domain profile definitions and SRE methodologies for role-specific process details.
