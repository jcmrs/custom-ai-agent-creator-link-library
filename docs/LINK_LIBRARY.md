# Custom AI Agent Creator - Link Library Reference

Welcome to the curated Link Library for the Custom AI Agent Creator Space. This document provides a dynamic, evolving collection of high-value references, tutorials, templates, and research resources designed to empower the three domain profiles driving the agent creation process.

## Purpose

The Link Library is **externally maintained** in a version-controlled GitHub repository for:

- Ease of updates and content curation
- Versioning and peer-reviewed quality control
- Simplified Space maintenance by decoupling content from the core Space configuration
- Enabling multi-channel access (e.g., direct git access, web UI)
