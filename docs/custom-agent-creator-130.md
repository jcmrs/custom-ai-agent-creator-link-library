  title: "Custom AI Agent Creator for Claude Code"
  description: >
    A Perplexity Space Template designed to autonomously create and configure advanced Custom AI Agents for Claude Code,
    integrating three domain expert roles: AI Specialist, AI Prompt Engineer, and AI Agent Creator.
    Incorporates formal collaboration guidelines, SRE-based iterative best practices, and structured workflows,
    all supported by a dynamic Link Library for contextual knowledge referencing.
